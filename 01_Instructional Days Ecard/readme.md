## Topic Description
This lesson introduces students to basic electronic components and circuitry. Students will design and create a simple circuit on paper (Electronic Greeting Card) that uses a cell battery, copper tape, and one LED light.

## Objectives
Students will be able to:
* Draw a circuit diagram with a simple circuit
* Identify necessary components of a simple circuit system (power, components, polarity, etc.)
* Peer review one another’s circuit diagrams according to a rubric
* Create a paper greeting card with electronic components (including designing, crafting, debugging, and sharing it with classmates) 

## Outline of the Lesson
* Journal Entry (5 minutes)
* Introduction to Electronic Textiles Unit (10 minute)
* Introduction to Electronic Card Making (10 minutes)
* Electronic Card Circuit Design (20 minutes)
* Electronic Card Construction (50 minutes)
* Share Electronic Cards (10 minutes)
* Design Notebook Entry (5 minutes)

## Student Activities
* Complete journal entry
* Design an electronic card circuit
* Construct an electronic card
* Share electronic cards with classmates
* Reflect in Design Notebook 

## Teaching/Learning Strategies
### Journal Entry
* What are some ways you can apply problem solving to designing and building things by hand?
	* Share responses with elbow partner
	* During the large group discussion, bring out connections to following the steps of an algorithm, using logic, problem solving, and debugging.
### Introduction to Electronic Textiles Unit 
* Students will learn about electronic circuits, make several projects, work in groups and alone, and learn to program using a text-based coding language. 
	* Give a high level description of the projects, especially the final one.
	* Describe the Design Notebook
		* The purpose of the notebook is to allow students to reflect on the processes they engaged and not just the final products
		* It can include reflections, procedures, reminders, tips, sketches, ideas, etc. 
		* There will be prompts after certain lessons
		* The idea is inspired by Leonardo Da Vinci’s notebook
			*  [https://www.bl.uk/collection-items/leonardo-da-vinci-notebook](https://www.bl.uk/collection-items/leonardo-da-vinci-notebook) 
		* It will be turned in as part of the Portfolio at the end
	* Describe the Portfolio

### Introduction to Circuits
* Distribute one wired LED to each student. Invite students to discuss and write observations in their Design Notebook. Pass out one coin cell battery to each student. Invite them to turn on their LEDs. Students should be encouraged to help one another to determine that all of the LEDs work properly and can turn on.
* Invite observations. Which side of the battery is positive? Does it matter which leg of the LED is touching the positive side of the battery? Which side of the LED needs to be connected to the positive side of the battery? (*positive-to-positive, negative-to-negative*)
	* How can you tell which side of the LED is positive or negative? 
		* Invite elbow partners to come up with ways to remember which side is which. Share a few ideas as a class. Write on the board.
		* [Two ways: The longer lead wire is positive. There is also a small notch in the plastic on the positive side of the LED]
		* **Pro tip***: It might help to color one leg (e.g., positive) of the LED with a marker to see it more easily.*
* Show the Chibitronics tutorial video (Circuit Sticker #1).  [http://chibitronics.com/simple-circuit-tutorial/](http://chibitronics.com/simple-circuit-tutorial/)  
* If desired: Demonstrate some eCards as examples from Technical Guide [link to e-textiles design ideas p. 56]. Or share a Google Images search on: “paper circuit LED” and “copper tape” 

### Circuit design
* Show the circuit diagram from the Chibitronics website (Circuit Drawing Handout):  [https://drive.google.com/open?id=1JVlrXR5zfgEZivIEK7IIqfyK-cVcwONF](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1JVlrXR5zfgEZivIEK7IIqfyK-cVcwONF)  
* Note: The copper tape provided in the Adafruit kits has conductive adhesive. Both the metallic side and the adhesive side conduct electricity.
* **Warning**: Pay special attention to the details, like how to turn corners without breaking the tape and maintaining conductivity, leaving a gap for the LED, etc. Explain to students that they will be using a regular LED with wire legs that needs to be taped onto the tape or under the tape (not LED stickers as in the video).
* Students should gather all of their necessary materials (paper, estimate how much copper tape they will need, battery, paperclip/binder clip, etc). 
* Make one paper circuit, following the diagram on the sketch (The LED will need to be reused on the final card, so treat it with care).
* Distribute scratch paper and pencils to each student so they can design their eCard in a circuit drawing (“blueprint”). *Recommended: Do this in the Design Notebook!*
* Elbow partners approve one another’s blueprints before students move on to crafting their actual projects.

### Electronic card construction
* Remind students that they may need to use Problem Solving and Debugging strategies to get them to work. 
* Make available colored pencils, markers, etc. so that students can embellish their cards. They are welcome to use additional materials as well.
* **Optional**: If students finish quickly there are more advanced projects they can do here (making a switch, adding a light, etc.):  [https://chibitronics.com/learn/](https://chibitronics.com/learn/)  
### Gallery Walk of eCards
* Split class in half and have half the group circulate room while the other half stay at their desk and present their projects to the circulators. Encourage circulators to ask questions like, “How did you do that?” “Why did you make those decisions?” 
* Have two groups switch roles. 

### Design Notebook
* Record some expert tips on circuits and crafting electronic greeting cards that you would share with a beginner. You may include sketches or diagrams.
