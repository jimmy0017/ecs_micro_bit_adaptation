# Instructional Days: 8-9. Introduction to micro:bit and Computational Circuits

**— Note: This lesson requires you to ~pre-program~ (upload code to) some micro:bit for your students to use. Please plan for the extra prep time. —**

## Topic Description
This lesson introduces how LEDs exhibit various behaviors through computational circuits.

## Objectives
Students will be able to:
* Design a computational circuit using a pre-programmed mini-computer
* Understand the role of a common ground

## Preparation
* Pre-upload “ [preprogrammedCP.py](https://github.com/jimmy0017/etextilesresearch/blob/master/08_Introduction%20to%20micro%20bit%20and%20Computational%20Circuits/preprogrammedCP.py) ” code onto enough micro:bit for each pair of students to use. 
* If you have questions about the micro:bit, check out this  [overview](https://microbit.org/guide/)  by its developer, micro:bit Educational Foundation.

## Download from Github
* Click the link of the code.
* Right click the raw button on the right and hit save as.

## Upload to Micro:bit
* Go to  [https://python.microbit.org/v/1.1](https://python.microbit.org/v/1.1)  
* Hit load, select the proper file.
* Then hit download to download the hex file which can be drag into the micro:bit

## Teaching/Learning Strategies
### Journal Entry(10 min)
* Think about what would make your wristband more awesome. What kind of functionality would be cool? (I.e., If you could customize the lights on your wristband to do more than just be on or off, what else might you make the lights do?) 
	* Have students share with elbow partners.
	
### Exploring computational circuits (40 min)
* Have students work together in pairs. 
* Students will need their wristband projects from days 4-7. Each pair will need two wristbands, one of each of its members.
* Distribute a micro:bit and USB micro cable (to plugged the micro:bit into a computer), and alligator clips for each pair of students. 
	* Have students examine the different pins and markings on the micro:bit (i.e., GND, 0, 1, 2, 3.3V.)
	* Especially note the GND (negative), 3.3V (positive), and numbered pins on the edges.
	* Ask pairs to brainstorm how they might connect all the components (wristbands, alligator clips, micro:bit, power source). 
	* *Details on what each pin does and where each sensor and switch are can be found here:* [https://microbit.org/guide/hardware/pins/](https://microbit.org/guide/hardware/pins/) 
* Facilitate a discussion on computational circuits.
	* Draw a circuit diagram on the board.
	* Draw an additional LED and have students brainstorm how they would connect it to the current circuit.
	* Have students share their ideas and update their drawings. 
	* Highlight one student diagram that has the LEDs connected in parallel (to the same pin on micro:bit) and ask students what the behavior of each light might be.
	* Highlight one student diagram that has LEDs connected to different pins on the micro:bit and ask students what the behavior of each light might be?
	* Have some students share out their designs and the expected behavior of their LEDs.
		* Make connections to the student diagrams from computational circuits.
	* Highlight a design that uses parallel circuits. Explore the idea of a common ground (one negative line connecting the LEDs’ negative sides to the negative of the micro:bit or battery holder) instead of each LED separately connecting all the way back to the battery holder. Do you think this might change the behavior of the lights? In Activity Three they will practice making parallel circuits.
### Design Notebook: Respond to one of the following (5 min)
* Reflecting on the day, what are some things you learned about computational circuits?
* Explain (draw or write) how to design a computational circuit such that all the lights perform different behaviors.
### Design project (15 min)
* In their Design Notebooks, have students *brainstorm* at least one project that they could make with the pre-programmed micro:bit. They should describe which pre-programmed light patterns they would use for their projects and how the chosen light patterns would enhance the design of their projects. Students should feel free to include sketches or diagrams.
* If students need some inspiration, here are some examples:
	* A plush bear that has a light up heart that uses the heartbeat pattern.
	* A cityscape with lights on the skyscrapers that blink differently.
* Have students share with elbow partners. 
* Have a few students share with the class or invite students to put their sketches up on a bulletin board.
